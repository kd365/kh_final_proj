## Safe Playgrounds in Washington DC

### All DC Playgrounds:

**Map 1:**

### Playgrounds to Population Demographic:

#### Age of Residents

**Map 2:**

**Map 3:**

A comparison of park locations (with density overlay) against a heatmap of a given area's population under the age of 18 reveals some interesting trends. 
Both Maps 3 and 4 show that those under the age of 18 seem to be clustered around the edges of Washington DC, which makes sense when one considers that there is typically more housing around the edges of the city in the suburbs. 

When compared to the location of playgrounds, though, there is some disparity. If one considers the most likely users for playgrounds to be those under the age of 18, it is interesting that the most dense locations of playgrounds are in areas where there is a lower ratio of the population under the age of 18 (Map 4). Map 3 seems to do a bit better when taking a look at the cluster in the center of the city- a few tracts with higher numbers of children under 18 coincide with the dense area of playgrounds, but several tracts in the same area have a very low number of residents in the appropriate age range.

This begs the question why these parks were created in these areas, and indicates a possible need for playgrounds in areas with a higher percentage or numbers of children. This could inform a city planner on which areas are suffering from a lack of play spaces. 

#### Economic Status of Residents

**Map 4:**
<style>.embed-container {position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%; height: 0; max-width: 100%;} .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container iframe{position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;} small{position: absolute; z-index: 40; bottom: 0; margin-bottom: -15px;}</style><div class="embed-container"><iframe width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" title="Mean Household Income vs Playground Density" src="//mygmu.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Embed/index.html?webmap=b1228d84574340989ea2f6ebcbe6e1b9&extent=-77.2733,38.81,-76.8541,38.9978&zoom=true&previewImage=false&scale=true&legend=true&disable_scroll=true&theme=light"></iframe></div>
