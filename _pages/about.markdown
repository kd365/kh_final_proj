# About this project...

## Research Questions This Project Considers

### How important are safe parks and playgrounds to a child’s development?

According to McKenzie et al. (2013), “national recommendations are for [children] to engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily.” As much of this activity occurs outside, it is important that any community include adequate open-air play spaces. This research will 	consist of an evaluation of any trends in the location of these facilities to identify any disparities between communities or identify any areas of need for further development. 

### How can a park or playground be considered safe?

To consider an area “safe” this research will involve comparing available geotagged moving violations, traffic accidents and fatalities, crime reports, sex offender registry, “Vision Zero Safety” reporting, and other available safety related data sets against the locations of the District’s open-air    	 play spaces.

### Are there currently open-air play spaces located in the areas of Washington DC where concentrated numbers of children reside?

This will be explored via a comparison of census population data by age for areas within Washington DC against the locations of playgrounds and parks across the District. 

### Are there any disparities in play area availability between socioeconomic areas as determined by census data?

Similarly, this will be explored via a comparison of the socioeconomic data available through census data for given areas in which play areas are either located in or nearby, or not.
