## Research Questions This Project Considers

### How important are safe parks and playgrounds to a child’s development?

To stress the importance of child play to childhood development, a child's right to rest and liesure, as well as to engage in age appropriate play has been recognized by the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights (Ginsburg, 2007). According to McKenzie et al. (2013), “national recommendations are for [children] to engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily.” As much of this activity occurs outside, it is important that any community include adequate open-air play spaces. This research will consist of an evaluation of any trends in the location of these facilities to identify any disparities between communities or identify any areas of need for further development. 

### How can one identify a safe playground?

To consider an area “safe” this research will involve comparing available geotagged traffic accidents and fatalities, crime reports, traffic data sets against the locations of the District’s playgrounds. For the purpose of this project, a playground is considered to be safer if it is not located in proximity to crimes or crashes, and if it is locaed in an area with additional traffic control (lower speeds and more speed humps).

### Are there currently open-air play spaces located in the areas of Washington DC where concentrated numbers of children reside?

This will be explored via a comparison of census population data by age for areas within Washington DC against the locations of playgrounds and parks across the District. 

### Are there any disparities in play area availability between socioeconomic areas as determined by census data?

Similarly, this will be explored via a comparison of the socioeconomic data available through census data for given areas in which play areas are either located in or nearby, or not.

## Overview

According to Cohen et al. (2019), though it has been identified that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is recommended for both youth and adults, and playgrounds are designed to foster this sort of activity, there is urrently a lack of information as to what are the features of a play space which might encourage their use. They go on to state that, there are barriers which ”contribute to the underuse of playgrounds, including heightened fears about crime, and the need for supervision of children” leading to the sparse use of playgrounds “especially in low- income neighborhoods.” 

McKenzie et al. discuss a number of factors which might lead to adults discouraging their children from using playgrounds, including the presence of incivilities (i.e. graffiti, litter, and overgrown vegetation) at a park, though this did not specifically cite perceived safety as a factor. They also note that “support for physical activity within an environment is often associated with its socioeconomic status (SES) …” which will be one of the areas explored through this research. 

This research seeks to highlight some of these additional barriers to facility use through the identification of areas that parents might deem as unsafe in hopes that city planners and local law enforcement might better be able to ocus on these areas for improvement of circumstances in the local area which might increase the use of available play spaces.
